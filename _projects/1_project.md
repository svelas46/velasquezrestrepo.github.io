As a scientist I do not intent only to do basic research but also to contribute to social dissemination and social appropriation of knowledge. I consider local communities are key in biodiversity research; as the most projects are developed in places that are their backyards, and preservation; because they can become custodians of their territory by adopting biodiversity-based economic activities as their main income source. 

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

    Between 2018 and 2019, I developed a research project called “Sustainable development and avitourism in the Colombian Chocó” (see more at erratico.info/Mecana). The objective was to bring to the surface the community’s innate knowledge about the winged jewels from their backyard, and along with them create a strategy to produce handicrafts, which were later made by indigenous women in the locality of Mecana (Bahia Solano, Chocó). In the end we used bio-knowledge as a mechanism to promote economic and social opportunities among local communities and contributed to birds’ diversity conservation through communitarian research and appropriation of knowledge. This is a clear example of my interest in involving local communities in research processes and through this contribute to face global challenges, such as reducing inequalities, increasing decent work and economic development, and preserving life on land.

    This is Daniel, back then a 12 year old kid from the local community starting his path as a bird guide, totally loving his new pair of binoculars and the birds he could se through them.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
