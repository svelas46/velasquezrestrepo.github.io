As a scientist I do not intent only to do basic research but also to contribute to social dissemination and social appropriation of knowledge. I consider local communities are key in biodiversity research; as the most projects are developed in places that are their backyards, and preservation; because they can become custodians of their territory by adopting biodiversity-based economic activities as their main income source.

Between 2018 and 2019, I developed a research project called “Sustainable development and avitourism in the Colombian Chocó” (see more at erratico.info/Mecana). The objective was to bring to the surface the community’s innate knowledge about the winged jewels from their backyard, and along with them create a strategy to produce handicrafts, which were later made by indigenous women in the locality of Mecana (Bahia Solano, Chocó). In the end we used bio-knowledge as a mechanism to promote economic and social opportunities among local communities and contributed to birds’ diversity conservation through communitarian research and appropriation of knowledge. This is a clear example of my interest in involving local communities in research processes and through this contribute to face global challenges, such as reducing inequalities, increasing decent work and economic development, and preserving life on land.

Some inhabitants of the municipality of Bahia Solano generate their income from economic activities related to the sea and its biological resources. In addition to fishing, humpback whale watching has become a source of employment. However, this type of tourism only occurs between July and October and, therefore, the community lacks other economic activities linked to nature tourism.
Based on this scenario, and with the support of Professor Juan Fernando Diaz-Nieto (coordinator of the Biodiversity Workshop), the curator and PhD in Anthropology from the University of Antioquia Alejandro Valencia-Tobon and the support of the Pacific Botanical Garden, I initiated a work that sought to generate a basic inventory of bird species present in the area of Mecana and, particularly, of the Pacific Botanical Garden. With this input, and working with local communities, I developed a productive strategy through the construction of handicrafts.
